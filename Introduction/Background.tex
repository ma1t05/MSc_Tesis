\section{Background}
This is a practical problem
that has not been studied before
to the best of our knowledge.
This stems
from the fact
that in other countries,
when accident occurs
cars owners
are allowed to move their cars
from the accident
if this obstructs traffic.
Unfortunately,
in many developing countries,
insurance agencies
ask their insures
not to move the car
until an adjuster arrives.

Nonetheless,
there are many related location problems
that look at similar issues.
This is the case of
ambulance location problems,
for instance,
where emergency service (ambulance)
must be located
in such a way that
ambulance arrive promptly
at the site of the accident.
A huge difference
between our problem
ant that
of an emergency service location
is that in these problems
it is matter of life-or-death,
whereas in our problem,
is not necessarily so.
This makes
the use of different objective function
and restrictions.

related problems are discussed.
