\section{Background}
This is a practical problem
that has not been studied before,
as this emergency system,
is not presented in many countries,
therefore, similar systems exists,
such is the case of ambulances, firefighter, patrols,
for which there are a lot of related articles,
but the features treated in them,
differ from our practical problem,
for the next factors
%type of space, %What means this?
radius of coverage,
multi-period,
service time,
type of arrivals

Berman %add cite
proposed a location problem
for emergency systems,
and calls The Queue Stochastic p-Median Problem.
