\section{Background}
The problem of locating car insurance agents
is a practical problem
that has not been studied before
to the best of our knowledge.
This comes
from the fact
that in other countries,
when an accident occurs
cars drivers
are allowed to move their cars
from the accident site
if this obstructs traffic.
Unfortunately,
in many developing countries,
insurance agencies
ask their insurees
not to move the car
until an adjuster has arrived.

Nonetheless,
there are many related location problems
that look at similar problems.
For example
the case of
ambulance location problems,
for instance,
where emergency services (ambulances)
must be located
in such a way that
ambulances arrive promptly
at the site of the accident.
A main difference
between our problem
and the one
of an emergency service location
is that in those problems
time is a matter of life-or-death,
and in the case of adjusters location
it is not necessarily so.
This resulting models
look then at different objective function
and constraints.

related problems are discussed.
