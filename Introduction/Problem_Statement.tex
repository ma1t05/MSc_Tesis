\section{Problem Statement}
A car insurance company
in countries such as Mexico
faces the daily issue
of how to locate
their insurance agents (adjusters),
in such a way
that they provide
the best possible service
to their customers.
Typically
the quality of service
is measured
by how quickly
the adjusters arrive
to the places
where an incident has occurred.

This problem
can be seen
as an emergency location system, % add cite
in which
it is desired to ``cover''
the territory under study
(city intersections)
by a fixed number of adjusters
so as to reduce
the average time
of arrival to accidents.
Another issue
that makes the problem
even more complex
is the fact
that accidents occur randomly
and decisions
on where to place the adjusters
must be made before
accidents occur.
