\section{Motivation}
When a car accident occurs,
traffic congestion starts to pile up.
This is because
customers are not allowed
to move their vehicles until
the adjuster arrives.
The adjuster must record and determine
the causes of the accident,
in order to
move the car from the accident area
and restore the flow.
Needless to say,
an early arrival
means everything to everyone.
Customers wait less,
and traffic jams
are cleared faster
when adjuster arrived promptly.

Given that accidents occur randomly,
the idea of this research
is to use stochastic location models
to derive efficient policies
that can be implemented
by insurance companies
based on historical data.
