\section{Motivation}
When a car accident occurs,
traffic congestion starts to pile up.
This is because
customers are not allowed to move their vehicles until the adjuster arrives.
The adjuster must record and determine the causes of the accident,
in order to move the car from the accident area
and restore the flow.
