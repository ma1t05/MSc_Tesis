\chapter{Introduction}

The main idea behind this thesis
is to develop mathematical models
to improve the service offered by car insurance agents,
determining the location
of adjusters available
to improve service
helping them arrive to accident sites sooner.
And determine
the number of adjusters required
to perform the service,
within desired quality of service.
