\section{Objectives}
The main objective
of this research are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Provide quantitative tools
  for scientific support
  for optimal location
  of car wreck adjusters
\item Develop or use
  adequate mathematical models
  for representing
  some of the important company concerns
\item Design and develop efficient solution techniques
  for handling real-world instance of the problem
\item Assess 
  the quality and value of the proposed techniques
  based on an appropriate experimental design
\end{itemize}
to determine the optimal bases (locations)
for placing the insurance company adjusters,
so as to minimize
the average or maximum response time
from customer calls
when accidents occur.
