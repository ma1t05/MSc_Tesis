\section{Organization}
This thesis is organized as follows:
Chapter \ref{ch:RelatedWork}
presents a brief literature review
of divers approaches of Emergency Service Systems (ESS),
starting with the simple deterministic models
and ending with the hypercube model and simulation models.
The problem statement
and two proposed models are presented in Chapter \ref{ch:Framework}.
Chapter \ref{ch:Heuristic} describes the proposed heuristic
and its components.
Chapter \ref{ch:Experiments} contains
the computational test
carried out
with the mathematical models
and the proposed heuristic.
Conclusions, contributions, 
and directions for future research
are highlighted in Chapter \ref{ch:Conclusions}.
Additionally, Appendix \ref{ch:Jarvis}
contains a summary of how to approximate the hypercube results,
and together with Appendix \ref{ch:Berman}
completes the explanation of how to estimate
the response times of a solution.
