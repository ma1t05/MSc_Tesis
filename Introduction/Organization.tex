\section{Organization}
This thesis is organized as follows:
Chapter \ref{ch:RelatedWork}
presents a brief literature review
of divers approaches of Emergency Service Systems (ESS),
starting with the simple deterministic models
and ending with the hypercube model and simulation models.
The problem statement
and two proposed models are presented in Chapter \ref{ch:Framework}.
Chapter \ref{ch:Heuristic} describes the heuristic method proposed
and their components.
Chapter \ref{ch:Experiments} contains
the experiments made to the models,
and to the heuristics to tune them.
Conclusions, contributions, 
and directions for future research
are highlighted in Chapter \ref{ch:Conclusions}.
Additionally, Appendix \ref{ch:Jarvis}
contains a summary of how to approximate the hypercube results,
and together with Appendix \ref{ch:Berman}
completes the explanation of how to estimate
the response times of a solution.
