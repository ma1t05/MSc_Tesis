\section{Mathematical Framework}

A first model was created
base on the one proposed by Goldberg \cite{goldberg1990validating}
for which
we made some relaxations
instead for obtaining a linear model.

A second model
that performs an additional simplification,
considering that
it is unlikely
to assign an adjuster
to a demand point
covered previously
by more adjusters,
omitting allocation variables
and adding restrictions
to guarantee
the correct order of allocation is introduced.
