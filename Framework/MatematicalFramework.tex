\section{Mathematical Framework}
In this chapter
we describe the solution methodology proposed
to solve the described problem.

A first model was created
base on proposed by Goldberg \cite{goldberg1990validating}
for which,
we made some relaxations
instead obtaining a linear model.

Proposed a second model
that performs an additional simplification,
considering that
it is unlikely
assign an adjuster
to a demand point
covered previously
by more adjusters,
omitting allocation variables
and adding restrictions
to guarantee
the correct order of allocation.
