\section{Mathematical Framework}

Two mathematical models are proposed,
the first model (model A) was created
base on the one proposed by Goldberg \cite{goldberg1990validating}
for which
we made some relaxations
instead to obtain a linear model.

The second model (model B)
has additional simplification,
considering that
it is unlikely
to assign an adjuster
to a demand point
covered previously
by more adjusters,
omitting allocation variables,
and adding constraints
to guarantee
the correct order of allocation.
