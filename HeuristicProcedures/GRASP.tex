\subsubsection{GRASP}
%Why did you choose GRASP?
We chose GRASP
because
in the proposed problem
any allocation of sites for adjusters
is a feasible solution,
so it was decided to give some intelligence
to this simple allocation
instead of choose
random points.
%What does it consist?
We start with a partial solution
(location of a smaller number of adjusters)
with only one adjuster allocated,
evaluate each site with a greedy function,
and choose one from the $\alpha$ best evaluated;
this process is repeated
until each adjuster is located.
%Which evaluation functions did you use?
Several functions were evaluated
for the constructive algorithm
%but because presented cooperativeness
%it is difficult
%to approximate the final results
%in a partial solution
%with a greedy function.
We used three greedy functions
to test the construction.
%Fist function
The first function,
was the p-mean
consisting
on the sum of the distances
between each demand point 
and their nearest adjuster.
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:grasp1}
  \sum_{j=1}^{m}{
    \sum_{i=1}^{n}{
      t_{ij}y_{ij}^{1}
    }
  }
\end{equation}
%Second function
For the second function,
%%\todo{Refrasear y simplificar descripcion}
%we try to incorporate cooperatively,
include in the evaluation
the distances
from each demand point 
with their $\ell$ nearest adjusters
($t_{ij}y_{ij}^{k}$),
plus \textit{idle} probability
given that is allocated
at order $k$.
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:grasp2}
  \sum_{j=1}^{m}{
    \sum_{k=1}^{\ell}{
      \sum_{i=1}^{n}{
        h_{ij}^{k}t_{ij}y_{ij}^{k}
      }
    }
  }
\end{equation}
%Third function
The third function
uses the Mean Service Time (MST) calibration method
proposed by Jarvis \cite{jarvis1985approximating},
to obtain more accuracy values
of the current mean response time.
