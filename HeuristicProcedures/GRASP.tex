\section{GRASP}
%Why did you choose GRASP?
Because is easy,
in the proposed problem
any allocation of sites for adjusters
is a feasible solution,
so it was decided to give some intelligence
to this allocation.
%What does it consist?
We start with a partial solution
(location of a smaller number of adjusters)
with only one adjuster allocated,
evaluate each site with the greedy function,
and choose one from the best $\alpha$ evaluations,
until locate each adjuster.
%Which evaluation functions did you use?
We use three greedy functions
to test the construction.
%Fist function
The first function,
was the p-mean
or the sum the distances
of each allocation 
from each located adjuster
with their nearest demand points.
%Second function
For the second function,
we try to incorporate cooperatively,
including in the evaluation
the distance of allocations
from each located adjuster,
with their $k$ nearest demand points
plus \textit{idle} probability
given that is allocated
to their $k-1$ nearest demand points.
%Third function
The third function,
consist in use the MST calibration method
proposed by Jarvis,
to obtain more accuracy values
of the current mean response time.
