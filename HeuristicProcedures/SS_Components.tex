\section{Description of Components}
The components of Scatter Search template \cite{glover1998template}
consist of
specific subroutines of the following types:
\begin{itemize}
\item A Diversification Generator
\item An Improvement Method
\item A Reference Set Update Method
\item A Subset Generation Method
\end{itemize}
We described below
each of the components.

\subsection{A Diversification Generator}
To generate
a collection of diverse trial solutions,
using an arbitrary trial solution
(or seed solution) as an input.
\input{HeuristicProcedures/alg_ss-init}

\subsection{An Improvement Method}
To transform
a trial solution
into one or more enhanced trial solutions. 
(
If no improvement
of the input trial solution results, 
the ``enhanced'' solution
is considered to be
the same as the input solution.)

\subsection{A Reference Set Update Method}
To build and maintain a Reference Set
consisting of the \textit{b} best solutions found
(where the value of \textit{b}
is typically small,
e.g., between 20 and 40),
organized to provide efficient accessing
by other parts of the method.
\input{HeuristicProcedures/alg_ss-phase}
 
\subsection{A Subset Generation Method}
 to operate
  on the Reference Set,
  to produce
  a subset of its solutions
  as a basis
  for creating
  combined solutions.
  \input{HeuristicProcedures/alg_ss-subset}
\item \textbf{A Solution Combination Method:}
  to transform
  a given subset of solutions 
  produced by the Subset Generation Method
  into
  one or more combined solution vectors.
  \input{HeuristicProcedures/alg_ss-combination}
\end{itemize}

\input{HeuristicProcedures/SS_Template}
\input{HeuristicProcedures/SS_Results}
