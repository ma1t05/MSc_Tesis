\section{Description of Components}
The components of Scatter Search template \cite{glover1998template}
consists of
specific subroutines of the following types:
\begin{itemize}
\item A Diversification Generator
\item An Improvement Method
\item A Reference Set Update Method
\item A Subset Generation Method
\end{itemize}
We described below
each of the components.

\subsection{A Diversification Generator}
To component is used to generate
a collection of diverse trial solutions,
using an arbitrary trial solution
(or seed solution) as an input.
%\input{HeuristicProcedures/alg_ss-init}
In our case,
the generator was a multi-start
consisting of a GRASP.
\input{HeuristicProcedures/GRASP}

\subsection{An Improvement Method}
The goal of this component
is to transform a trial solution
into one or more enhanced trial solutions. 
If no improvement
of the input trial solution results, 
the ``enhanced'' solution
is considered to be
the same as the input solution.

We developed two improvement methods,
the first one is an adaptation
of the method proposed by Berman et al. \cite{berman1987stochastic}
(see Appendix \ref{ch:Berman} for mode details)
and the second one,
a Local Search
described in the next section.

\input{HeuristicProcedures/LocalSearch}

\subsection{A Reference Set Update Method}
This method is used
to build and maintain a Reference Set
consisting of the \textit{b} best solutions found
(where the value of \textit{b}
is typically small,
e.g., between 20 and 40),
organized in an array
to provide efficient accessing
by other parts of the method.

We choose
a two level Reference Set
to maintain
good quality solutions
and diverse solutions.
This is
because the combination method
generates similar solutions as the input,
%And we opt for be dynamic
%since the number
%of generated solutions
%is big (proportional to \textit{p}).
and Moreover,
the size of the reference set is dynamicall determined,
according to $p$.

Whenever the Reference Set is update
with a set of solutions
%\todo{No se entiende!}
the update method
first try to incorporate the solutions
by quality criteria;
%because the Reference Set is divided
%in two parts,
%first try to accommodate each solution
if a solutions enters the Reference Set,
degrades a lower quality solution,
removing the worst solution of the Reference Set.
These steps are shown in Algorithm \ref{alg:rs_update}.
\input{HeuristicProcedures/alg_RefSetUpdate}

After adding solutions to the Reference Set
by using the quality criterion,
% Update Diversity
every solution taht was generated
and did not enter the Reference Set,
displaced by a better solution,
or actually
a member of the diverse part of the Reference Set
is evaluated to be in the Reference Set
as a diverse solution.
As showns by the Algorithm \ref{alg:rs_updatediv}.
\input{HeuristicProcedures/alg_RefSetUpdateDiversity}
%solutions that do not enter the Reference Set
%and those that have been removed,
%are considered to be part
%of the Reference Set
%by using the diversity criterion.
%reassessing the diverse solutions,
%since they evaluation depends
%on the quality members.

%\input{HeuristicProcedures/fig-Update}

\subsection{A Subset Generation Method}
This component operates on the Reference Set,
%to produce a subset of its solutions
%as a basis for creating combined solutions.
it is used to create subsets
of solutions that are combined
by the Combination Method.
\input{HeuristicProcedures/alg_SubsetGeneration}
We only look for subsets of size two,
i.e. pairs of solutions;
because our Reference Set is dynamic,
at the begining of each iteration
we label the solutions as new and old
to identify them,
and avoid create pairs previous combined.
To generate the pairs
we use
a new solution with another new solution,
%\todo{Refrasear}
after
if there are old solutions
we make pairs
with a new solution
and an old solution.

Is imporatan to notice that
the new solutions that enters in the Reference Set
at the current iteration
are not part of the subsets
until the next iteration.

\subsection{A Solution Combination Method}
With this component,
our scatter search
transforms a given subset of solutions 
produced by the Subset Generation Method
into
one or more combined solution vectors.

We choose a path relinking as a combination method
consisting of
determining a match between servers,
this match can be
\begin{itemize}
\item Perfect Matching:
  minimizing the distance between paired servers
\item Workload Matching:
  sorting the servers of both solutions
  according to their workload,
  and match them according to these sorted lists.
\item Random Matching
\end{itemize}
Once we have the matching
we proceed from one solution
to interchange each server,
one by one
until the other solution is reached;
in each interchange
we have a new solution.
To make the interchanges
we have three options:
\begin{itemize}
\item Nearest First
\item Farthest First
\item Random
\end{itemize}
