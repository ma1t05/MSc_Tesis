\section{Description of Components}
The components of Scatter Search template \cite{glover1998template}
consist of
specific subroutines of the following types:
\begin{itemize}
\item A Diversification Generator
\item An Improvement Method
\item A Reference Set Update Method
\item A Subset Generation Method
\end{itemize}
We described below
each of the components.

\subsection{A Diversification Generator}
To generate
a collection of diverse trial solutions,
using an arbitrary trial solution
(or seed solution) as an input.
\input{HeuristicProcedures/alg_ss-init}
In our case,
the generator was a multi-start
consisting of a GRASP
\input{HeuristicProcedures/GRASP}

\subsection{An Improvement Method}
To transform
a trial solution
into one or more enhanced trial solutions. 
(
If no improvement
of the input trial solution results, 
the ``enhanced'' solution
is considered to be
the same as the input solution.)

We have two improvement methods,
the first an adaptation
of the proposed method by Berman et al. \cite{berman1987stochastic}
and the second,
a Local Search
described in the next section.
\input{HeuristicProcedures/LocalSearch}

\subsection{A Reference Set Update Method}
To build and maintain a Reference Set
consisting of the \textit{b} best solutions found
(where the value of \textit{b}
is typically small,
e.g., between 20 and 40),
organized to provide efficient accessing
by other parts of the method.

We choose
a two tier Reference Set
to maintain a part of diverse solutions,
this because the combination method
generates similar solutions to input.
And we opt for be dynamic
since the number
of generated solutions
is big (proportional to \textit{p}).

\subsection{A Subset Generation Method}
To operate on the Reference Set,
to produce a subset of its solutions
as a basis for creating combined solutions.
\input{HeuristicProcedures/alg_ss-subset}
We only look for subsets of size two
i.e. pairs of solutions,
because our Reference Set is dynamic,
to identify the new solutions,
we label solutions as new and old
at the start of each iteration.
We combine first the new solutions
between them,
next the new solutions with the old,
the new solutions that enters in the Reference Set
as a combined solutions,
is not part of the subsets
until the next iteration.
Each solution generated
and did not enter in the Reference Set,
displaced by a better solution,
or actually
a member of the diverse part of the Reference Set
is evaluated to be in the Reference Set
as a diverse solution.

\subsection{A Solution Combination Method}
To transform a given subset of solutions 
produced by the Subset Generation Method
into
one or more combined solution vectors.
\input{HeuristicProcedures/alg_ss-combination}
We choose a path relinking as a combination method
consisting of
determine a match between servers,
this match can be
\begin{itemize}
\item Perfect Matching:
  minimizing the distance between paired servers
\item Workload Matching:
  sorting the servers of both solutions
  according to the workloads,
  and match them according these sorted lists.
\item Random Matching
\end{itemize}
once we have the matching
we proceed from one solution
to interchange each server
(one by step)
until end in the other solution,
in each interchange
we have a new solution.
To make the interchanges
we have three options
\begin{itemize}
\item Nearest First
\item Farthest First
\item Random
\end{itemize}
