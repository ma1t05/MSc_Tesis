\label{ch:Heuristic}
Because the problem stochasticity
linear models
can not evaluate solutions accurately,
since the assumption made
which assumes
that all adjusters have the same occupation,
so the Hypercube model is used
in conjunction with
the service mean time calibration process
(see Berman et al. \cite{berman1987stochastic})
to obtain the main parameters.
