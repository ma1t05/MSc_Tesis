\chapter{Heuristic Procedures}
Because the problem stochasticity
can not evaluate solutions accurately,
so the Hypercube model is used.

Several functions were evaluated
for constructive algorithm
but because presented cooperativeness
it is difficult
to approximate the final results
in a partial solution
with a greedy function.

To improve these solutions,
a scatter-search was implemented
with a dynamic reference set.
We opted for a dynamic reference set
due the number of solutions generated
in each combination is big.
