\subsection{Proposed Local Search}
%the move
The move considered
is to relocate an agent from its current position
to a different position.
%the neighborhood
The entire neighborhood
consist of all possible moves
that can take place from a given solution.
However,
due to the high cost of move relocation assessment,
a reduced neighborhood is considered.
Thus,
instead of considering all possible moves,
the procedure focuses on relocating the adjuster
with the smallest workload
to a place around or near the adjuster with the largest workload.
