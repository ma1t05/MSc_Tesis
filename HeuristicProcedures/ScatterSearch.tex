\section{Proposed Metaheuristic}
The Scatter Search (SS)
is an evolutionary approach
introduced by Glover \cite{glover1977heuristics}
as a metaheuristic for integer programming.
It is based on diversifying the search
through the solution space.
It operates on a set of solutions,
named the Reference Set,
formed by good and diverse solutions of the main population.
These solutions are combined
with the aim of generate
new solutions with better fitness,
while maintaining diversity.
The General Scheme can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:SS_GS}.
\input{HeuristicProcedures/fig-GeneralScheme}

\subsection{Diversity of a Solution}
% La diversidad de mide respecto al conjunto de referencia actual
The diversity of a solution,
is measured relative to the Reference Set;
% Se usa el perfect matching para calcular el costo
the perfect matching
is evaluated
with each one of the solutions in the Reference Set,
where the cost consist in
the sum of the distances
from each server of the given solution
and their match in the solution of the Reference Set.
% Se utiliza el minimo costo como medida de diversidad
The minimum cost perfect matching
is used as diversity value.

\subsection{Scatter Search}
A Scatter-Search
with a dynamic reference set
was implemented,
and a path relinking method
is used as combination method.
We used a dynamic reference set
given that the number of solutions generated
in each combination is large.
To enhanced the solutions
two improvement methods are included,
one proposed by Berman \cite{berman1987stochastic},
and a proposed Local Search.

In Algorithm \ref{alg:SSInitial} (see below)
a Reference Set is created,
consisting in the bests \textit{b} solutions,
and the most diverse \textit{b} solutions.

In Algorithm \ref{alg:SSPhase} (see below),
each pair of solutions
is combined using path relinking.
However,
since the Reference Set is dynamic
some solutions are displaced
before been combined.
