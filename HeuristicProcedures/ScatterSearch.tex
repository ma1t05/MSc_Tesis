\section{Proposed Metaheuristic}
A Scatter-Search
with a dynamic reference set
was implemented,
and a path relinking method
is used as combination method.
We used a dynamic reference set
given that the number of solutions generated
in each combination is large.
To enhanced the solutions
two improvement methods are included,
one proposed by Berman \cite{berman1987stochastic},
and a proposed Local Search.

\input{HeuristicProcedures/alg_ss-template_init}
In Algorithm \ref{alg:SSInitial} (see below)
a Reference Set is created,
consisting in the bests \textit{b} solutions,
and the most diverse \text{b} solutions.
To measure the diversity of a solution,
the minimum cost perfect matching
with each of the solutions of the Reference Set.

\input{HeuristicProcedures/alg_ss-template_phase}
In Algorithm \ref{alg:SSPhase} (see bellow),
each pair of solutions
is combined using path relinking.
However,
since the Reference Set is dynamic
some solutions are displaced
before been combined.
