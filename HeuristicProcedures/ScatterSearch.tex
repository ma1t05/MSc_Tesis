\section{Proposed Metaheuristic}
A Scatter-Search was implemented
with a dynamic reference set,
and a path relinking method
to combine solutions.
We opted for a dynamic reference set
due the number of solutions generated
in each combination is big.
To enhanced the solutions
two improvement methods are included,
one proposed by Berman \cite{berman1987stochastic},
and a proposed Local Search.

\input{HeuristicProcedures/alg_ss-template_init}
In the algorithm \ref{alg:SSInitial}
a Reference Set is created,
consisting in the bests \textit{b} solutions,
and the most diverse \text{b} solutions,
to measure the diversity
the metric used is
the minimum perfect matching
with each solution in the Reference Set.

\input{HeuristicProcedures/alg_ss-template_phase}
In the algorithm \ref{alg:SSPhase}
Each pair  of solutions
is tried to combine
using the path relinking,
because the Reference Set is dynamic
some pairs do not come to be combined,
since the solutions
are displaced
before trying to combine them.
