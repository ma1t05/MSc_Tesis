\section{Scatter Search}
Components of Scatter Search template \cite{glover1998template}
consist of
specific subroutines of the following types:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{A Diversification Generator:}
  to generate
  a collection of diverse trial solutions,
  using an arbitrary trial solution
  (or seed solution) as an input.
\item \textbf{An Improvement Method:}
  to transform
  a trial solution
  into one or more enhanced trial solutions. 
  (
  If no improvement
  of the input trial solution results, 
  the ``enhanced'' solution
  is considered to be
  the same as the input solution.)
\item \textbf{A Reference Set Update Method:}
  to build and maintain a Reference Set
  consisting of the \textit{b} best solutions found
  (where the value of \textit{b}
  is typically small,
  e.g., between 20 and 40),
  organized to provide efficient accessing
  by other parts of the method.
\item \textbf{A Subset Generation Method:}
  to operate
  on the Reference Set,
  to produce
  a subset of its solutions
  as a basis
  for creating
  combined solutions.
\item \textbf{A Solution Combination Method:}
  to transform
  a given subset of solutions 
  produced by the Subset Generation Method
  into
  one or more combined solution vectors.
