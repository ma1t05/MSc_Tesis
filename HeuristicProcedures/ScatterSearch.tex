\section{Proposed Metaheuristic}
A Scatter-Search was implemented
with a dynamic reference set,
and a path relinking method
to combine solutions.
We opted for a dynamic reference set
due the number of solutions generated
in each combination is big.
To enchanced the solutions
two improvement methods are included,
one proposed by Berman \cite{berman1987stochastic},
and the other a Local Seach.
