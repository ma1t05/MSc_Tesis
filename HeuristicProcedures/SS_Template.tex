\subsection{Initial Phase}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{Seed Solution Step.}
  Create one or more seed solutions,
  which are
  arbitrary trial solutions
  used to
  initiate
  the remainder of the method.
\item \textit{Diversification Generator.}
  Use the Diversification Generator
  to generate
  diverse trial solutions
  from the seed solution(s).
\item \textit{Improvement and Reference Set Update Methods.}
  For each trial solution
  produced in Step 2,
  use the Improvement Method
  to create one or more enhanced trial solutions.
  During successive applications of this step,
  maintain and update
  a Reference Set
  consisting of the \textit{b} best solutions found.
\item \textit{Repeat.}
  Execute Steps 2 and 3
  until
  producing some designated
  total number of enhanced trial solutions
  as a source of candidates
  for the Reference Set.
\end{enumerate}
