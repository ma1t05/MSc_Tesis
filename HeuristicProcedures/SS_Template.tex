\subsubsection{Initial Phase}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{(Seed Solution Step.)}
  Create one or more seed solutions,
  which are
  arbitrary trial solutions
  used to
  initiate
  the remainder of the method.
\item \textit{(Diversification Generator.)}
  Use the Diversification Generator
  to generate
  diverse trial solutions
  from the seed solution(s).
\item \textit{(Improvement and Reference Set Update Methods.)}
  For each trial solution
  produced in Step 2,
  use the Improvement Method
  to create one or more enhanced trial solutions.
  During successive applications of this step,
  maintain and update
  a Reference Set
  consisting of the \textit{b} best solutions found.
\item \textit{(Repeat.)}
  Execute Steps 2 and 3
  until
  producing some designated
  total number of enhanced trial solutions
  as a source of candidates
  for the Reference Set.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Path Relinking Phase}
\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{4}
\item \textit{(Subset Generation Method.)}
  Generate subsets of the Reference Set
  as a basis for creating combined solutions.
\item \textit{(Solution Combination Method.)}
  For each subset X produced in Step 5,
  use the Solution Combination Method
  to produce a set C(X)
  that consists
  of one or more combined solutions.
  Treat each member of C(X)
  as a trial solution
  for the following step.
\item \textit{(Improvement and Reference Set Update Methods.)}
  For each trial solution produced in Step 6,
  use the Improvement Method
  to create one or more enhanced trial solutions,
  while continuing
  to maintain and update the Reference Set.
\item \textit{(Repeat.)}
  Execute Steps 5-7 in repeated sequence,
  until
  reaching a specified cutoff limit
  on the total number of iterations.
\end{enumerate}
