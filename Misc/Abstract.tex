\paragraph{Problem Description:}
When a traffic accident occurs
in cities with a large traffic flow
the roads surrounding the crash site
are affected by traffic congestions.
In some countries, such as Mexico,
even small accidents are troublesome
due to the fact
that a claim adjuster
from the car insurance company
must arrive to the site
and document the accident
before the vehicle may be moved
as required by law.
Thus,
in this particular setting,
the adjusters location
becomes a key factor in providing timely service.

\paragraph{Objectives and method of study:}
%Aquí debes poner tus objetivos y métodos de estudio.
The aim of this thesis is to
\begin{itemize}
\item Provide quantitative tools
with scientific support
for the optimal location
of car wreck adjusters.
\item Develop
adequate mathematical models
for representing
some of the important company concerns.
Design and develop efficient solution techniques
for handling real-world instances of the problem.
\item Assess
the performance of the proposed techniques
based on an appropriate experimental design.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Contributions and Conclusions:}
%Y aquí tus contribuciones y conclusiones.
%(También es parte del formato).
The most important contributions of this work
are the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Two integer programming models
  are introduced
  with the aim of
  minimizing average response time.
\item The second model
  takes into account
  special features
  to reduce the number of variables.
\item A scatter search heuristic
  was designed, implemented, and tested
  on a wide set of instances
  with very good results.
\end{itemize}
