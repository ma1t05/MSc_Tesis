\section{GRASP}
Several instances were tested
with different $\alpha$ values
to determine the value of $\alpha$ to use.
The value of $\alpha = 0$ means that
the procedure becomes completely greedy,
in contravention
a value of $\alpha = 1$ means that
the procedure becomes completely random.

The test suggest
that
with a more random version
there are more different solutions
and a wide range of objective values
achieving better solutions.
