\section{GRASP}
The purpose of this experiment
is to assess the behavior of the three greedy functions
used by the greedy randomized construction
of the diversificatione genrator method,
as well as the $\alpha$ parameter,

To this end
we run the heuristic consiting of
the construction phase only
(that is ousidide of the Scatter Search -
Path Relinking method).
%The results are shown in table \ref{tab:}.

Several instances were tested
with different $\alpha$ values
(from 0 to 1 in steps of 0.05)
to determine the value of $\alpha$ to use.
The value of $\alpha = 0$ means that
the procedure becomes completely greedy,
and a value of $\alpha = 1$ means that
the procedure becomes completely random.

The test suggest
that
with a more random version
there are more different solutions
and a wide range of objective values
achieving better solutions.
