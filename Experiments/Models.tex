\section{Model A}
%This model was tested 
%with a benchmark instance of 30 points, 
%which sets $V$ and $W$ are the same.
%For values of $p = 1,\ldots,7$
%the optimal solution was found in less than one minute.
%
%For other benchmark instances
%was impossible to find the solution
%because they have more than 300 points,
%and the proposed model grows to over one million variables.
%  For some large instances ($n = 50$ , $m = 30$)%
