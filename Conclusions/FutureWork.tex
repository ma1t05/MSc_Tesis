\section{Future Work}
There are
several areas of opportunity
for further work in this area.
First,
the empirical test
were done for a relatively
small number of instances.
Generating several instances
for a given size
would allow
a more sound study
with a corresponding statistical analysis.

Another task
is to test the solution methodology
in real world problems.
This wolud of course
involve a considerable amount of work
particulary
when considering the potential accident sites
in large cities.

From the heuristic perspective,
advanced strategies
such as memory adaptive programming
or exploring different local search neighborhoods
may be worthwhile investigating.

The methods developed in this thesis
provide a recommendation as to where the adjusters should be located.
Since the problem is subject to the random occurance of the accidents,
performance indicators based on simulation models
must be calculated and compared with current industry policies.
