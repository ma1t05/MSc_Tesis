\section{Future Work}
Due to policy changes
of the insurance agency that collaboration had,
It was not possible to obtain information
to create real instances,
and measure the benefits of the methods here proposed,
against the policies currently used.

Some tests are pending to be done
\begin{itemize}
\item Extend the testing of models
\item Comparison between simulation results
  and Mean Service Time Calibration Process
  for diverse solutions.
\end{itemize}
