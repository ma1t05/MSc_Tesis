\chapter{Introduction}

The idea is to develop models and methods for improving the service
offered by insurance agents, helping them arrive to the accident sites
sooner, and determining the number of adjusters required to perform
the service within the desired standards.

\section{Problem Statement}

\section{Background}

\section{Motivation}
When a car accident occurs, traffic congestion starts to pile up. This is
because customers are not allowed to move their vehicles until the
adjuster arrives. The adjuster must record and determine the causes of
the accident, in order to move the car from the accident area and restore
the flow.

\section{Objectives}
The aim of this work is to support decision-making, 
regardin location of insure agents to attend car wrecks.
The main goal is to determine the optimal bases (locations) for placing
the insurance company adjusters, so as to minimize the average or
maximum response time from customer calls when accidents occur.
