mentioned previously

% Ideal Situation
The location and dispatching policies
used by insurance agencies
should aim
to arrive to incidents
early as possible,
so that
the workloads for adjusters are balanced.
The location policies
should be optimized for service time
but also should consider
cooperatively
based on workloads.

% Problem
However,
current insurance agency policies
are empirical,
and does not consider cooperative.
Taking more time to arrive at incidents,
making the insurance agency
less competitive,
and generating more traffic congestion.
