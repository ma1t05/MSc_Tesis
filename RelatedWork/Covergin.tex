the location set covering model (LSCM)
introduced Toregas et al. \cite{toregas1971location}
the aim
is to minimize
the number of ambulances needed
to cover all demand points.
This model
ignores several aspects of real-life problems,
the most important
probably being that
once an ambulance is dispatched,
some demand points
are no longer covered.
However,
provide
a lower bound
on the number of ambulances
required to ensure full coverage.

In the maximal covering location problem (MCLP)
originally proposed by Church and ReVelle \cite{church1974maximal}
is an alternative approach
proposed to counter some of the shortcomings of the LSCM
is to maximize population coverage
subject to limited ambulance availability.

Daskin,
and all other set covergin approaches,
assume that
travel times are deterministic
and coverage is an 'all-or-nothing' property.
