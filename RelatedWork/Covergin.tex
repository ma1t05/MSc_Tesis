the location set covering model (LSCM)
introduced Toregas et al. \cite{toregas1971location}
\todo[size=\tiny,caption={Add ref}]{include toregas1971location in refs}
the aim
is to minimize
the number of ambulances needed
to cover all demand points.
This model
ignores several aspects of real-life problems,
the most important
probably being that
once an ambulance is dispatched,
some demand points
are no longer covered.
However,
provide
a lower bound
on the number of ambulances
required to ensure full coverage.

In the maximal covering location problem (MCLP)
originally proposed by Church and ReVelle \cite{church1974maximal}
\todo[size=\tiny,caption={Add ref}]{include church1974maximal in refs}
is an alternative approach
proposed to counter some of the shortcomings of the LSCM
is to maximize population coverage
subject to limited ambulance availability.
