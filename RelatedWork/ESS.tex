Given a region
with
a certain spatial distribution of demands for service
and
given \textit{N} response units
that are spatially distributed
throughout the region,
the districting problem
is often called
as follows:
``How should the region
be partitioned into areas
of primary responsability (districts)
so as
the best achieve some level
or combination of levels of service?''

The location problem,
which is obviously closey related
to the district problem,
is often stated as follows:
``How should
the \textit{N} response units
be located or positioned
while not responding to calls for service?''

The work-load balancing problem,
which is in turn
related to the districting and location problems,
is as follows:
``How shoulds the units
be positioned and selected for dispatch
in order to balance (equalize)
the work-loads among units?''
