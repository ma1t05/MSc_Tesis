\chapter{Related Work}
In this chapter
the first works
related to location of vehicles
are introduced.

The models are classified in two main categories,
deterministic and probabilistic.
Deterministic models
are used at the planning stage
and ignore stochastic considerations
regarding the availability of vehicles.
Probabilistic models
reflect the fact that
vehicles operate as servers in a queueing system
and cannot always answer a call.
