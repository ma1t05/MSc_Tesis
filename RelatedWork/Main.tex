In this chapter,
we review
the most relevant
location models.
% source: brotcorner2003ambulance
The location models
are classified in two main categories,
deterministic and probabilistic.
Deterministic models
are used typically at the planning stage
and ignore stochastic considerations
regarding the availability of servers
or the distribution of the demand.
Probabilistic models
reflect the fact that
vehicles operate as servers in a queueing system
and are not always available
to answer a call.

The location literature is very extense,
therefore
we focus te discussion in this chapter
on models
that are more typically used
in the location of emergency services.
As stated before,
no previous work
on location of car wreck adjustes exist
to the best of my knowledge;
however,
there are many common elements
between our problem
and the problem of location emergency services.
