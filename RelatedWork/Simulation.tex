Simulation models
can be formulated with a great deal of detail
and hence can be validated.

Simulation
is used for evaluating EMS system performance in numerous papers
as in Savas \cite{savas1969simulation},
Berlin and Liebman \cite{berlin1974mathematical},
and Swoveland et al. \cite{swoveland1973simulation},

Their provides in general
a wealth of output measures,
drawback is that
they are rarely used
because of high runtime and data collection costs.
These models have some objectionable assumptions,
but successful applications do exist in the literature.
