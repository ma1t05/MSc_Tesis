\section{Simulation Models}
% source: golberg1990validating
Simulation models
can be formulated with great detail,
and have been used for evaluating EMS system performance in numerous papers
such as Savas \cite{savas1969simulation},
Berlin and Liebman \cite{berlin1974mathematical},
and Swoveland et al. \cite{swoveland1973simulation}.
These simulation approaches provide
in general
a whealth of output measures,
Their main drawback
is that they are rarely used
because of high runtimes and data collection costs.
These models have some questionable assumptions,
but successful applications do exist in the literature.
