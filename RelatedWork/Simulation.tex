Simulation models
can be formulated with great detail
and hence can be validated.

Simulation
is used for evaluating EMS system performance in numerous papers
as in Savas \cite{savas1969simulation},
Berlin and Liebman \cite{berlin1974mathematical},
and Swoveland et al. \cite{swoveland1973simulation},

In general,
simulation models provide
several measurement outputs,
a drawback is that
they are rarely used
because of high runtime and data collection costs.
These models have some questionable assumptions,
but successful applications do exist in the literature.
