Location models
are classified in two main categories,
deterministic and probabilistic.
Deterministic models
are typically used at the planning stage
and ignore stochastic considerations
regarding the availability of servers
or the demand distribution.
Probabilistic models
reflect the fact that
vehicles operate as servers in a queuing system
and are not always available
to answer a call;

these models allow
a more accurate planning
of Emergency Service Systems (ESSs)
at the strategic level.
They were initially developed
based on the assumptions
that servers are independent
and do not cooperate,
which is not realistic in practice.

The location literature is very extense,
therefore
we focus the discussion in this chapter
on models
that are typically used
in the location of emergency services.
As stated before,
no previous work
on location of car wreck adjusters exists
to the best of my knowledge;
however,
there are many common elements
between our problem
and the problem of location of emergency services.
