\subsection{P-Median Models}
% source: golberg1990validating
The first approaches
incorporate median type objectives,
the aim of these problems
is to minimize the sum of distances
between each demand point
and its server.
\todo[inline]{Explicar en que consisten estos modelos}
Examples of such models are
the deterministic $p$-median model of Hakimi \cite{hakimi1964optimum},
the stochastic p-median 
and the vector assignment p-median models
of Church and Weaver \cite{weaver1983computational,weaver1985median},
and the capacitated p-median model
of Schilling and Pirkul \cite{pirkul1988siting}

The strength of these models
is that optimal solution procedures
that can accommodate practical problems
have been developed.
Weaknesses include assumptions
such as noncooperation between vehicles,
the probability of each system state must be known,
and the fraction of call
served by the closest, second closest, etc.
must be known for each zone.
