\subsection{P-Median Models}
% source: golberg1990validating
The first approaches
incorporate median type objectives,
the aim of this problem is
\todo[inline]{Explicar en que consisten estos modelos}
Examples of such models are
the deterministic p-median of Hakimi \cite{hakimi1964optimum},
the stochastic p-median and the vector assignment p-median of Church and Weaver
\cite{weaver1983computational,weaver1985median}
and the capacitated p-median of Schilling and Pirkul \cite{pirkul1988siting}

The strength of these models
is that optimal solution procedures
have been developed
and can accommodate practical problems.
Weaknesses include assumptions
such as noncooperation between vehicles,
the probability of each system state is known
and the fraction of call
served by the closest, second closest, etc.
is known for each zone.
