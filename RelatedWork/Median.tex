\subsection{P-Median Models}
% source: golberg1990validating
The strength of these models
is that optimal solution procedures
have been developed
that can accommodate practical problems.
Weaknesses include assumptions
such as noncooperation between vehicles,
the probability of each system state is known
and the fraction of call
served by the closest, second closest, etc.
is known for each zone.
